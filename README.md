# What is Machine Learning?

Modern Defination of ML: â€œA computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance  measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E."


Any Machine Learning problem can be assigned to one of two broad classification:
1. Supervised Learning
2. Unsupervised Learning

# Supervised Learning
We are given a dataset and already known what our correct output should look like, having the idea that there is a relationship  between   the input and the output.

- Also called learning for examplars.

Supervised learning problems can be classified into "regression" and "classification" problems.

# Unsupervised Learning
Allows us to approach a problems with little or no idea what our results should look like. We can drive this structure by clustering the data based on relationships among the variable in the data.

In essence: The aim of unsupervised learning is to find clusters of similar inputs in the data without being explicitly told that some datapoints belong to one class and the other in other classes. The algorithm has to discover this similarity by itself. 

# Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement Learning works through trial and error which actions yield the greatest rewards. For example : Computer learn to play a video game, drive a car, etc ...?



# Basic machine learning process for supervised learning:
1. Acquire data from some source
2. Clean and Organize the data
3. Spliting of Training and Testing data
4. Train/Fit ML Model on Training data
5. Evaluate ML Model on the Test data
6. Adjust Model parametrs 
7. Deplot the ML Model on New incoming data


# Basic machine learning process for unsupervised learning:
1. Acquire data from some source
2. Clean and Organize the data
3. Create Training data
4. Train/Fit ML Model on Training data
5. Evaluate ML Model on the Training data

# Hold Out Sets or Evaluation Sets
1. Acquire data from some source
2. Clean and Organize the data
3. Spliting of Training, Testing and Holdout data
4. Train/Fit ML Model on Training data
5. Test ML Model on the Test data
6. Adjust Model parametrs 
7. Evaluate ML Model on Holdout data
8. Deplot the ML Model on New incoming data
